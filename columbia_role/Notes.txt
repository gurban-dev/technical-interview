Format: 30-minute technical interview

Focus: One primary question covering either Python Recursion, Django
ORM/DRF, or a related/closely intertwined topic. The purpose is to
evaluate my technical skills.

The first five to 10 minutes, it will be like a conversational thing.
Speaking it through, and then hands-on coding to solve the problem.

Getting stuck and receiving a lot of help as a result indicates that you
didn't pass.

I've attached some example questions for reference. While you likely won't
see these exact questions, they'll give you a good sense of what to expect.
The interview is split into two parts: the first half will be a discussion
of the concept, followed by a coding exercise. For context, a recent
candidate was asked to reverse a linked list.

The screening Questions in this file were asked during the first phone call.

Recursion with Python

Question 1:
In your own words, what is a base case in recursion?

Answer:
The condition that ends the recursion or returns a final value.

Follow-up Question:
What happens if you forget the base case in a recursive function?

Answer:
Stack overflow or infinite recursion. This is where the coding site Stack
Overflow gets its name from.


Question 2:
Can you give an example of a problem where recursion is a natural fit?

Answer:
Prompt until they answer. There are many, but an intro CS class will generally
start with tree traversal or synonyms like "walking a tree."

Example applications: Working with file directories, family tree, organisational
chart, etc.


Quesion 3:
When might you replace recursion with iteration in Python?

Answer:
To avoid hitting recursion limits or for performance. In most cases, it will
require using an explicit stack/queue, as with tree traversal.

Django and ORM

Question 1:
What does select_related do in the Django ORM?

Answer:
It performs an SQL join and fetches related objects in the same query.


Question 2:
You would use prefetch_related instead of select_related?

Answer:
When the related object is a reverse or ManyToMany relation.


Question 3:
How would you fix and diagnose an N+1 query issue in a DRF view returning
nested data?

Answer:
Use select_related or prefetch_related in the queryset.


Question 4:
What does the term N+1 mean?

Answer:
The term N+1 means that for each item in a queryset, an additional query
is performed to fetch related data, resulting in one plus the number of
items queries.


Question 5:
What is the difference between a serialiser and a model serialiser in DRF?

Answer:
The difference between a serialiser and model serialiser in DRF is that model
serialiser auto-generates fields from the model, whereas serialiser requires
writing explicit fields/logic.


Question 6:
What does annotate(Count(...)) let you do in the ORM?

Answer:
Add aggregated fields (e.g., counts) directly to querysets for sorting/filtering
without extra queries.


Question 7:
When would you use select_for_update?

Answer:
Inside a transaction to lock rows for update and prevent race conditions.
