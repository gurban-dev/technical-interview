Behave in a friendly manner with the interviewer as
if you are working with them on the same team.

1. Break down what you were asked.

   Ask follow-up clarifying questions about
   the input and the expected output.

   E.g.
   Input: Given an array of integers, reverse the array.

   Could the array be empty?

   Are the integers bounded? Meaning can they be really large
   or really small?

   Can I have a zero value?

   Does it store duplicate values?

   Does it exclusively store data of one type?

   Will there always be a solution or does it depend
   on the input?

   Should I be returning the head of the linked list or the
   tail?

2. Visualise the problem by drawing it out.

3. Ask for test cases if you are not given any.

   Verbally walk through why you understand the output
   for the test case.

   Create test cases for edge cases: empty array, negative value,
   duplicate value, etc.

4. Before coding, write an algorithm in a fashion that
   makes it appear that you don't know the answer up front.

   Begin with a naive approach like a brute force algorithm,
   and explain to the interviewer why the approach isn't
   optimal.

5. Translating the algorithm into source code:

   Avoid long periods of silence while coding and persistently
   update the interviewer on what it is that you're doing.

   Break down each task in a single function.

6. Explain why you went with your approach.

   Analyze the time and space complexity.

   If it's not the most optimal solution, explain why you
   think it's not and tell them you are confident that
   there's an approach with a more effcient time and space
   complexity and that you just didn't have enough time to
   come up with it.

   If you have additional time, optimise your solution.
